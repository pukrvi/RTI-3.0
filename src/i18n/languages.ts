/**
 * The Eighth Schedule.
 *
 * The live portal offers two languages in a dropdown: English and Hindi. The
 * Constitution recognises twenty-two, and the request body on that portal
 * accepts the script of none of them.
 *
 * All twenty-three are listed here, in their own script, because a citizen
 * should be able to see their language named on a government service even
 * before it is translated — and because listing them makes the gap visible
 * rather than hiding it. Two are live. Adding a third is one JSON file plus
 * one line in `DICTIONARIES`; the `available` flag below flips itself.
